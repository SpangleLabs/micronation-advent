Sat in the bar.
Reminiscing of old times?
Drifting afar.',

'Islands, Islands in the sky
Do you really fly so high? 
You wish you may, you wish you might
Just barely make canon tonight.',

'Oh, oh Ocia, where did you go,
Oh, oh Ocia, does anybody know?
Oh, oh Ocia, we miss your vex and bile,
Oh, oh Ocia, deep down it made us smile.',

'Spamfree wikis galore,
Shireroth&#39;s hopes did soar,
Corey has got hold,
Tales of mergers were told,
All riches are bound to unfold.',

'Oh these mysterious isles,
Nothing about you in the files.
No matter how hard I look,
There&#39;s no information in any book.',

'For ten long years the nation stood:
Istvanistan (now gone for good?)
But all things pass and time moves on
Bastion City joins the throng
But it&#39;s purpose is hard to see
Friendship or great conspiracy?',

'There once was an overfull map.
Which was missing a northern ice cap.
Leng appeared there,
Now the island is bare,
Yet Scott still gets in a flap',

'Holzborg has hidden her heart:
Missing, in a maze of ever more minuscule mapping modes
Pointless provinces perpetuated by patriotic pride, perhaps?
Or a deep mystery beyond mortal ken?',

'Bright was the day and the wind fair,
As the young Einhorn set out to carve himself a kingdom.
Bards sing of the greatness that resulted, and we can add but this:
Sagas always go better with mead.',

'"Roleplayers!" they scorn
Gralus thrives while others die
Life&#39;s a BANANA',

'From the NISS I looked down,
Upon Micras below,
&#39;Bet you wish you had a space fleet now!&#39; said I,
&#39;And a Butter Bull running the show!&#39;',

'Many hopes and dreams
Spiteful treachery so soon!
Goddess guard your hearts',

'Lovely Lovely, where did you go,
From your dear nation did so many grow.
You caused massive change in our community here,
But you&#39;ll still be viewed on a lower tier.',

'Frigga, Freyja, Idunn, our warmth in the cold
Creators of Stormark in the greatest story ever told.
Sweet, loving Fulltrui, Mighty and Divine,
Guardians of Stormark till the end of time.',

'Craitland remembers the reason
For the holiday season.
With Frólihaanga this week,
Their winter will not be bleak!',

'And now Cibola,
Hated by many people,
But still less than Leng',

'Cornflakes,
Cornflakes,
Cornflakes,
Batavia.',

'Oh Victoria,
Still the nicest web design
Even after years',

'From Nafticon blue
Light of Antica still shines
Winning land by war',

'Staylight’s departure
Shireroth to Antica
Can’t be seen on map'
